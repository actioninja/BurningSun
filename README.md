# Burning Sun
##### A Minecraft Challenge Mod

More detailed gameplay info is availible on the curseforge page which is linked at the header.

### for developers:

Burning Sun is licensed under GPL v3.  It's a really big license with a lot of legalese which makes it pretty hard to read.

The github feature for outlining license properties is pretty good, but I'll also sum them up here:

##### You can:
1. Download this mod for free, and download the source code of it for free
2. Use this mod for any commercial purposes without limitation
3. Freely redistribute downloaded versions of this mod for free, along with the source code
4. Modify the source code of the mod with no limitations
5. Redistribute your modifications of the source code and compiled versions with some limitations:
  * Your modifications also need to be open source
  * Your modifications also need to be licensed under GPL v3
  * You need to clearly state what your changes are compared to the base version

##### You can't:
1. Demand liability for any damage it may or may not cause
2. Demand a warranty
3. Use this mod for the purposes of taking over the world

Ok, I might have made up that last one.
